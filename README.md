# SBA-PortfolioWebsite
This is the SBA for HTML/JavaScript.

This website is a portfolio-type website for a friend of mine. They're a photographer.

General notes: The burger menu is non-functional. all links in the header, when being clicked, turn purple.

MAIN: Shows a carousel of their recent work that one can drag to scroll through the images. You can also access all the other pages from here.

Contact: This is the contact form which has form and regex validation to make sure all fields are filled correctly. You can also check the output in the console. All fields are saved to objects and printed to show that it's working. These objects can then be saved or used however needed.

About: This page is the about me section which changes the icon in the top left to a gif of Sebulba from Star Wars and has a little description beneath.

Newsletter: This page has a little message in a box as well as a video begging the user to sign up. There's also an email input form that also has form and regex validation implemented.

All carousels: Contains an image, description, and title of the image. Theres also a table that shows the sizes of the image and price. Beside that there's a size selector and an add to cart button. Functionality of the button is not implemented (cart is not implemented either). The button has a slight animation to it where when it's hovered it moves up a little and when clicked, the button turns purple. 

Hope you enjoy the website! :)
